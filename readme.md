# Neural Network using Numpy.The aim of this notebook is to build a neural network that acts as logistic regression. The process will be raw, that is, without using specialized libraries (Tensorflow, Keras). I will only use Numpy to be able to perform the necessary calculations (specifically forward and back propagation). The neural network consists, specifically, in a Cat/Non-cat neural network.
